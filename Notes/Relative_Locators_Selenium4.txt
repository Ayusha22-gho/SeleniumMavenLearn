Relative Locators
-----------------
Provides a way to Locate elements based on their relationship with other nearby elements.
--------------

Methods     Purpose
-------	--------
above(By)	element located above the specified element (use tagname)
below(By)	
toLeftOf(By)
toRightOf(By)
near(By)	element located near(in any direction) the specified element, around 50px

Advantage
---------

More intitutive
Ease readibility
Test scripts more resilant to changes
Minimum manual intervention
Robust and reliable test
False positive or false negative scenarios reduction
More dynamic test scenarios (responsive designs)
Quick to grasp
Consistency across different screen resolution as not dependednt on specific coordinates
Combiation with other locators
-----------------

Selenium uses JavaScript function getBoundingClientRect() to 
determine the size and position of elements on the page and can use the
info to locate neigbouring elements.

By emailLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName("input")).above(By.id("password"));

--------------------------
Chaining Relative Locators
--------------------------

Email
--------------------------
Password
--------------------------

Cancel	Submit

By submitLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName("button")).below(By.id("email")).toRightOf(By.id("cancel"));

--------------
SHADOW DOM uses JavaScrptExcecuter
--------------

encapsulation of DOM and styling in a web component.
-----------------------

Selenium cannot directly interact with shadow dom as the elements are encapsulated and not directlt accessible.

Dynamic Shadow DOM -> can be dynamically generated by javascript which becomes difficult for selenium to locate
Performabce and Maintainence overhead
Debigging & Inspection.

-------------------
Handling ShadowDOM
------------------

Webdriver IO -> built on top of selenium webdiver 
TestCafe -> can interact with shadow dom seamlessley
Cypress -> proveide API to access shadow dom
Puppeteer -> node js , can use DOM manipulation 
Playwright -> provide API's to handle SHdow DOM
Protractor -> for Angular applications
