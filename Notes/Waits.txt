WAITS
=======

Why?
-----
->Page load time is required
->element visibility and intractability
->Async operations => ex: ajax call takes time so wait is required so that these operations are completed

WebDriver Waits : to synchronize test with the state of a web application
=======================================

Implicit Waits : 
->defines a global timeout for the webdriver instance
->webdriver will wait for a specific time waiting for the element
->driver.manage().timeouts()
->default waiting mechanism
-----------------------------------
=>Once established, it remains in effect for the entire duration that the browser is open.
=>default value = 0, that is no implicit wait until specified
=>global effecting all elements and actions performed
=>setting appropriate timeout allows suffiecient time for elements to load

driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

scriptTimeout(Duration.ofMinutes(2)) //driver will wait max 2 minutes for all the async scripts to get finished executing
pageLoadTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2)) // webdriver will wait for the page to load for max of 2 seconds before throwing an exception



=================================================================
Expicit Waits 
->can define conditions
WebDriver Wait and Fluent Wait

=>more intelligent and dynamic
=>allows program to pause dynamically loaded ajax elements 
=>to declare explicit waits, Expected Conditions class is used   

Syntax:
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10)

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.condition(locator))
