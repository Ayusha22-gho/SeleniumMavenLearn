WINDOWS
==============================================================

New Window opens -> selenium webdriver cannot identify elements in child window
Throw Nosuchelement exception error

Selenium Webdrivers has methods to handle windows
-> interact with windows
->opening and closing windows
->switching focus b/w them

Each window has a unique window handle allowing switching

->Parent Window : primary interaction
->Child Window : as a result oof action performed in PW

Window Handle -> unique code made of letters and numbers

Example : popup window , focus needs to be switched to the popup window. using window handle


Methods

getWindowHandle() => returns a unique handle of the currently focused window
getWindowHandles() => retrieves handles of all open windows
switchTo().window(handle)

Why we need to handle?
----------------------
Popup windows :Dialog , login window
Multiple page flows : testing across multiple windows web page : Ex e commerce website
External links : switch to new contexts
User Interactions : user filling a form in popup window
Third party Integrations : verification ex payment gateway
User Scenarios : selecting a product and seeing it's details in new window
Consistence and flow : validating windows are opn /close etc.

=============================================================

FRAMES
=============================================================
Divide webpage into multiple independent sections

iFrames => inline frames

Identify frames : switchTo() method
defaultContent() : focus to be returned to the main page

Handling
========
driver.switchTo().frame(0) //By index
By name or id
By webelement

Nested Frames
=============

->Switch from outermost frame to the inner frame sequentially.


// switch to outerframe
//switch to inner frame
//perform operations in inner frame
//switch to parent frame : parentFrame()
//switch to default content
